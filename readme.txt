The ScapeViewerª for WordPress enables easy embedded linking in WordPress to tours, slideshows, and online galleries built using the Whitepointª framework. WordPress authors may choose to have a Whitepoint authoring account to build their own smart tours - called scapes - and link to them.

== Description ==

ScapeViewer for WordPress helps WordPress authors easily link Whitepoint (http://www.whitepoint.mobi) tours in WordPress.

Now, scapes - tours that are built using the Whitepoint framework - can be quickly linked with a graphic and aligned in WordPress postings.

The necessary script that is required to open ScapeViewer is automatically added by the plugin so there is no messy scripting or knowledge of coding required.

WordPress authors simply choose the requested settings and a shortcode is generated that can be copied then pasted anywhere the WordPress author desires. 

Whitepoint is perfect for building photo tours, online galleries, storyboards, slideshows, and smart tours - an alternative to traditional virtual tours.

One major advantage is that scapes are automatically available via the Whitepoint apps for iOS and Android. This way, Whitepoint authors can build intelligent online tours that are available via mobile devices to users anywhere.

This makes Whitepoint a great tool for museums, galleries, commercial or residential real estate, education, and the hospitality industry.
Property tours - such as those of hotels or resorts - can be quickly built and easily managed using Whitepoint.

To take advantage of the WordPress ScapeViewer by Whitepoint, all WordPress authors need is a scape ID for a scape that has been built using Whitepoint. Anyone can link to a Whitepoint scape using that scape's ID. A Whitepoint authoring account is not required in order to use this plugin and link to scapes from a WordPress site. 

The Whitepoint framework for building intelligent mobile-friendly tours is free and available to anyone at https://authoring.whitepoint.mobi.
